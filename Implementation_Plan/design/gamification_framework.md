# Gamification Framework: TypeQuest

## 1. The Core Loop
1.  **Action**: User completes a Lesson (Story Mode) or Daily Sprint.
2.  **Reward**: User receives XP, "Ink" (Currency), and a localized rating (Stars).
3.  **Progress**: XP levels up the Avatar; Ink buys specialized equipment (Keyboards).
4.  **Motivation**: Unlocking the next "Map Node" or beating a Global Leaderboard score.

## 2. Mechanics & Systems

### 2.1 RPG Progression (Skill Tree)
*   **Visual Map**: Users traverse diverse biomes (e.g., *Home Row Harbor*).
*   **Node Requirements**:
    *   **Pass**: ≥94% Accuracy, ≥20 WPM (Unlocks next node).
    *   **Gold Star**: ≥98% Accuracy, ≥50 WPM (Bonus XP).
*   **Avatar Leveling**: Higher levels unlock visual flair for the cursor and "Combo" effects.

### 2.2 Streak & Multiplier
*   **Login Streak**: Daily login grants Ink multiplier (1.1x -> 1.5x cap).
*   **Lesson Streak**: Consecutively hitting "Gold Star" grants "Flow State" visualization (screen edges glow).

### 2.3 Economy ("Ink")
*   **Currency**: **Ink**. Earned by typing correctly.
*   **The Ink Shop**:
    *   **Keyboard Skins**: Mechanical (Blue/Red/Brown switches), Neon, Retro.
    *   **Sound Packs**: Typewriter, Sci-Fi.
    *   **Streak Freeze**: Protects stats for 24h.
*   **Monetization**: "Ink" is gameplay-only. Subscriptions unlock infinite hearts/energy (if energy system used) or premium skins.

## 3. Social & Competitive
*   **Daily Sprint**: A global, fixed-seed 60-second challenge. All users type the exact same text. Leaderboards reset daily.
*   **Leagues**: Weekly promotion/relegation based on total XP earned.

### 3.2 Reward Schedule
*   **Immediate**: Haptic tap + Sound on correct key.
*   **Short-term**: Lesson completion screen with stars/confetti.
*   **Medium-term**: Daily Quest completion (e.g., "Type 500 words with 98% accuracy").
*   **Long-term**: League promotion, finishing a "World".

## 4. Age-Appropriate Engagement

### 4.1 Kids Mode

*   **Rewards**: Stickers for a digital sticker book.

### 4.2 Adult/Pro Mode
