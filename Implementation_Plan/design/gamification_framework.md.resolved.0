# Gamification Framework

## 1. The Core Loop
1.  **Action**: User completes a typing lesson or practice session.
2.  **Reward**: User receives XP (Experience Points), "KeyCoins" (Soft Currency), and feedback rating (S, A, B, C).
3.  **Progress**: XP fills the Level bar; KeyCoins accumulate for the Shop.
4.  **Motivation**: User unlocks new content (next node on Skill Tree) or cosmetics, driving the next Action.

## 2. Mechanics & Systems

### 2.1 Progression Tracking
*   **Skill Tree Map**: Instead of a linear list, use a visual map (like Candy Crush or Duolingo) where users travel through "Worlds" (e.g., Home Row Harbor, Capital City, Symbol Summit).
*   **Player Level**: Infinite leveling system. Each level up grants a "Loot Box" (or defined reward) containing a unique theme color or avatar part.

### 2.2 Streak System
*   **Daily Streak**: Visual fire icon for consecutive days practiced.
*   **Streak Freeze**: Consumable item purchasable with KeyCoins to protect the streak for one day.
*   **Early Bird / Night Owl**: Bonus XP for practicing at specific times.

### 2.3 Achievements (The Trophy Room)
*   **Milestone Badges**: "Typed 10,000 words", "Reached 50 WPM", "Perfect Accuracy 10x".
*   **Secret Achievements**: Hidden goals to encourage exploration (e.g., "Typed 100 WPM for the first time").

### 2.4 Social Competition (Optional but Recommended)
*   **Leagues**: Weekly cohorts of 30 players. Top 5 promote to next league (Bronze -> Silver -> Gold). Bottom 5 demote.
*   **Friends List**: "Nudge" friends who haven't practiced.
*   **Ghost Racing**: Race against a replay of a friend's best run (asynchronous multiplayer).

## 3. Economy (Ethical Design)

### 3.1 Currency: KeyCoins
*   **Earned by**: Completing lessons, daily quests, maintaining streaks.
*   **Spent on**:
    *   **Cosmetics**: Keyboard themes (Retro, Neon, Mechanical Clicky Sounds), Backgrounds, Avatars.
    *   **Utility**: Streak Freezes.
*   **No Pay-to-Win**: Real money can only buy "Premium" status (subscription), not KeyCoins directly (or limit it to avoid predatory optics).

### 3.2 Reward Schedule
*   **Immediate**: Haptic tap + Sound on correct key.
*   **Short-term**: Lesson completion screen with stars/confetti.
*   **Medium-term**: Daily Quest completion (e.g., "Type 500 words with 98% accuracy").
*   **Long-term**: League promotion, finishing a "World".

## 4. Age-Appropriate Engagement

### 4.1 Kids Mode
*   **Visuals**: Bright, character-based avatars.
*   **Narrative**: "Help the Space Cat fix his ship by typing the correct codes!"
*   **Rewards**: Stickers for a digital sticker book.

### 4.2 Adult/Pro Mode
*   **Visuals**: Sleek, minimalist data visualization.
*   **Narrative**: Mastery and self-improvement ("You are in the top 5% of typists").
*   **Rewards**: Dark mode themes, professional sound packs (Cherry MX Blue switch sounds).
