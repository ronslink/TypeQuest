# Stage Progression Tests

TypeQuest uses high-stakes **Stage Pass Tests** to ensure users have mastered the specific criteria of their current level before advancing to more complex tasks.

## 🎯 Purpose of Stage Tests
Unlike standard lessons, Stage Tests are comprehensive evaluations. They act as "gatekeepers" that must be passed to unlock the next biome on the skill tree.

## 📋 Test Criteria by Stage

| Stage | Test Name | Focus Criteria | Passing Requirements |

## 🧪 How Progression Works

1. **Sequential Unlocking**: Within a stage, lessons must be completed in order.
2. **The Final Hurdle**: The last lesson of every stage is a **Stage Pass Test** (marked with a gold shield icon).
3. **Locking**: Even if you complete all previous lessons, the next stage remains locked until the current stage's **Pass Test** is successfully completed with the required accuracy and speed.
4. **Retake Randomization**: To prevent rote memorization and ensure true mastery, Stage Pass Tests pull from a dynamic **Content Pool**. Every time you retake a test, the app randomly selects a different criteria-matched variation.
5. **Remediation**: If a Pass Test is failed, the system recommends specific "Weakness Training" lessons based on the keys missed during the test.
