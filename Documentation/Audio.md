# Audio & Immersion Strategy

Audio in TypeQuest is more than just feedback; it’s a tool for building rhythm and maintaining "Flow State."

## ⌨️ Mechanical Switch Profiles

Users can choose from multiple audio "Switch" profiles in the settings to customize their typing feel.

| Profile | Real-World Analog | Sound Characteristic | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tactile Blue** | Cherry MX Blue | High-pitched, clicky. | High focus, rhythmic feedback. |
| **Linear Red** | Cherry MX Red | Soft, quiet "thud." | Night typing, minimal distraction. |
| **Tactile Brown** | Cherry MX Brown | Balanced "bump" sound. | Default balanced experience. |
| **Retro Modern** | IBM Model M | Heavy, metallic clack. | Nostalgic enthusiasts. |

## 🎵 Music & Soundscapes

- **Flow Channels**: Low-fidelity (Lo-Fi) beats designed to minimize cognitive load during practice.
- **Dynamic Intensity**: The music subtly changes or adds layers as the user's "Lesson Streak" increases.
- **Biomechanical Cues**: Subtle "pings" for posture alerts or reaching a target WPM mid-session.

## 🔊 UI Feedback

- **Correct Key**: Short, crisp transient.
- **Error Key**: Low-frequency, muted thud (avoiding harsh buzzes to reduce anxiety).
- **Session Success**: Harmonic chord progression.
- **Session Failure**: Muted, slightly dissonant resolve.
