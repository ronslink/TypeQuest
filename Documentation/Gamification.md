# Gamification & Engagement

TypeQuest uses an RPG-inspired framework to keep users motivated and engaged throughout their touch typing journey.

## 🔄 The Core Loop

1. **Perform**: User completes a typing lesson or daily challenge.
2. **Reward**: User earns **XP** and **Ink** (currency) based on accuracy and speed.
3. **Progress**: XP increments the User Level; Ink is used in the **Shop**.
4. **Unlock**: Higher levels and lesson completion unlock new map nodes and visual customizations.

## 📈 Progression Systems

### User Levels & XP
- **Base XP**: Granted for every lesson completed.
- **Bonuses**: Accuracy multipliers and "Gold Star" bonuses for perfect/near-perfect sessions.
- **Level Scaling**: Requirements increase exponentially to maintain long-term challenge.

### The Skill Tree
Lessons are arranged on a visual map. 
- **Requirements**: Lower nodes must be passed (Accuracy ≥ 94%) to unlock connected nodes.
- **Themes**: Different biomes (e.g., "Home Row Harbor") provide visual variety.

## 💰 Economy ("Ink")

"Ink" is our non-premium, gameplay-driven currency.

- **Earning**: Proportional to the number of correct characters typed.
- **The Ink Shop**:
    - **Keyboard Skins**: Visual themes (e.g., Neon, Retro, Carbon).
    - **Mechanical Switches**: Changes the sound profile (e.g., Blue, Brown, Red).
    - **Streak Freeze**: Protects the user's daily streak.

## 🔥 Engagement Mechanics

- **Daily Sprints**: Global leaderboards with a fixed-seed text block.
- **Streaks**: Encourages daily practice with increasing "Ink" multipliers.
- **Flow State**: Sustained accuracy triggers visual effects (screen glow) and focused audio cues.
